" Heritage Treasures: An In-Depth Analysis of UNESCO World Heritage Sites (2019) is a data visualization project aimed at exploring the global distribution and key characteristics of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Using Tableau, the project provides interactive dashboards and visual summaries to help users understand patterns based on region, country, heritage category (Cultural, Natural, or Mixed), and the year of inscription. The dataset, sourced from UNESCOâ€™s 2019 records, includes fields like site name, location, category, endangered status, and description. The project highlights countries with the highest number of sites, analyzes trends over time, and identifies endangered heritage areas. Through engaging visualizations such as global maps, bar charts, and category breakdowns, the analysis offers meaningful insights into how cultural and natural heritage is preserved and distributed worldwide. This project is designed for educational purposes and showcases how data analytics and visualization can support cultural awareness and heritage conservation."
